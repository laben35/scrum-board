#Scrum-board

Scrum-board represents a sprint.
A sprint is a gathering of people involved in a project in order to focus on developing this project.
Scrum-board lasts two days.
Sprints often take place in the vicinity of conferences attended by most of the project team, but they can also be hosted by one of the participants on their premises or in another interesting place.
Les sprints sont organisés autour d'idées provenant de la méthode de gestion du développement logiciel Extreme Programming.
An essential advantage of sprints organization is that project members meet face-to-face in a user-friendly way and establish more effective communication than when they work together remotely.
Scrum-board was developed using the Symfony framework and was inspired using the Agile framework.
Agile, just boundaries, barriers.
Agile has four values:
- Responding to change (break tunnel effect)
- Working products (Continuous Integration)
- Individuals & Interactions
- Customer Collaboration.
Scrum-board creates user accounts, and deletes them.
